# From Perceptrons to Deep Networks
### Perceptrons:Early Deep Learning Algorithms
1. basic neural network building block
2. for supervised learning
3. finishing jobs that mapping samples to labels
#### implementation:
1. combine the inputs and weights with weighted sum transfer function

$ x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} $
